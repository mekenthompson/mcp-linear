# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: Enhanced Project and Initiative Tools
# Branch: ralph/enhanced-project-initiative-tools

## Codebase Patterns
- createProject/updateProject service methods already accept leadId, memberIds - pass labelIds as `labelIds` (not `projectLabelIds`)
- Type guards in type-guards.ts define the TypeScript interface for tool arguments
- Tool definitions in definitions/*.ts define the JSON schema for MCP tools
- Handlers simply pass args to service methods (no need to extract individual fields)
- Linear SDK uses `labelIds` for project labels in both create and update

- Already implemented - leadId, memberIds, labelIds already in createProjectToolDefinition
- Type guard isCreateProjectArgs already included these fields
- Handler passes full args object to service
- **Learnings:** Check existing implementation before starting work - PRD was already partially implemented

- Added leadId, memberIds, labelIds to updateProjectToolDefinition input_schema
- Updated isUpdateProjectArgs type guard to include these fields
- Updated LinearService.updateProject to accept and pass labelIds to client
- Files changed:
  - src/tools/definitions/project-tools.ts
  - src/tools/type-guards.ts  
  - src/services/linear-service.ts
- **Learnings:**
  - Linear SDK ProjectUpdateInput uses `labelIds` not `projectLabelIds`
  - Always check the SDK types (index.d.cts) to confirm correct field names
